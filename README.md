# Blink

It's small teleport module (for short distances) for tera-proxy.

You will be teleported to the side where your character is looking.

To rotate the character, use the ASDW buttons.

# General

[!blink] - for teleportation for several meters

[!back]  - go back if before you teleported badly

[!save]  - save the place that would later return there

[!loc]   - teleport to a saved location \ enter again to go back to where you came from

# TODO

1. Make teleportation more safe (Now it's too easy to get stuck in textures)

2. Add the ability to track and teleport to the [position of the camera]

3. Add the ability to use the hotkey
